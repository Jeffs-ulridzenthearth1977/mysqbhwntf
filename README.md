OMG! Just finished The Life List and honestly, my brain’s all over the place. 😅 Like, first off, who writes these characters? They’re relatable in that “I’d never do that” kind of way. It's like, SERIOUSLY, if I had a dollar every time someone did something ridiculous in that movie, I'd probably download the movie without thinking twice just to laugh at it again, you know?

But for real though, remember when you were like you HAVE to watch the movie!? You weren’t wrong. I mean, parts of it got me thinking—between the existential crisis moments and the bizarre plot twists that came outta nowhere. One minute you're deep in some philosophical debate, next, you're dodging emotional roller coasters that hit harder than my morning caffeine fix.

> And let's talk about the visuals for a sec. Like, whoever did the cinematography, chef's kiss. Gave off those artsy vibes that make you wanna pretend you understand film on a deeper level 😂 But, ugh, some characters! If that one dude wasn't the most predictable, I swear I could write the script for the sequel in my sleep. HA!

Anyway, I'm rambling, but that ending?! WHAT WAS THAT??? I’m telling you, my jaw actually dropped. I didn’t see it coming. Maybe I would've if I hadn't been too busy trying to make sense of the subplot with the cat. Didn't help much, man. Still processing—mind’s doing little backflips.

document.write(What even is this?); 

Alright, enough of my brain dump. Gonna grab some sleep before I dive down another internet rabbit hole tomorrow. You've gotta watch it and let me know what you think. Good night! 🌙
